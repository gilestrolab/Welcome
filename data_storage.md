Storing data
===============

Data is stored, in college on our personal NAS.
Please request access from the administrator.
This is a short description of users, directory structure and sync possibilities.


Users
------------------------------------------
* Long term lab members have their own user name and belong to `lab_members`, which grant them:
    * read-only access to "/auto_generated_data"
    * read-only to other members' homes
    * read-write to their own home
    * read-write to "lab_shared"
    * read-write to "Public"
* Short term lab members/guests share the same user name:
    * login = labguest
    * read-only access to "auto_generated_data"
    * read-only to "lab_shared"
* Nodes use:
    * login = node
    * RW access to "auto_generated_data"

Directories organisation:
------------------------------------------

In addition to individual users' home, their are three special directories. Here is a short description of each of them:
* `auto_generated_data`:  contains *private* data generated by our acquisition systems. It is **read-only for lab members and lab guests**.
* `shared`:  contains *private* data shared in the lab. It is **read-write for lab members** and  **read-only for lab guests**.
* `Public`:  contains *public* data meant to be shared with in-college collaborators. It is **read-write for lab members** and  **read-only for lab guests**.
* `homes`: every user has a personal home which is read-write for him/herself. In addition, it is **read-only for other lab members and lab guests**.

Access data
----------------------------------
TODO

Adding a new lab member (admin)
------------------------------------------------

Through the NAS web interface (http://nas.lab.gilest.ro/:8080/cgi-bin/).
Go to Control Panel/Privilege Settings/Users/Create
Then simply add user to the `lab_members` group

Remote Backups
------------------------
This system is a storage platform, **not a backup**.
Every week, on sunday, files should be archived on an external storage (e.g. box.com).
This is TODO.
