Storing data
===============

Data is stored, in college on our personal NAS.
Please request access from the administrator.
This is a short description of users, directory structure and sync possibilities.


Users
------------------------------------------
* Long term lab members have their own user name and belong to `lab_members`, which grant them:

    * RO access to "/auto_generated_data"
    * RO to other members' homes
    * RW to their own home
    * RW to "lab_shared"
    * RW to "Public"
* Short term lab members/guests share the same user name:

    * login = labguest
    * RO access to "auto_generated_data"
    * RO to "lab_shared"

* Nodes use:

    * login = node

    * RW access to "auto_generated_data"

Directories organisation:
------------------------------------------

In addition to individual users' home, their are three special directories. Here is a short description of each of them:

* `auto_generated_data`:  contains *private* data generated by our acquisition systems. It is **read-only for lab members and lab guests**.

* `shared`:  contains *private* data shared in the lab. It is **read-write for lab members** and  **read-only for lab guests**.

* `Public`:  contains *public* data meant to be shared with in-college collaborators. It is **read-write for lab members** and  **read-only for lab guests**.

* `homes`: every user has a personal home which is read-write for him/herself. In addition, it is **read-only for other lab members and lab guests**.
