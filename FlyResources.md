# Some helpful websites and tools for some in silico research on fly genes

[FlyBase](http://flybase.org) - Ties to together resources about the individual genes, including GBrowse gene locus viewer, predicted function according to InterPro and UniProt, lists of associated papers, etc.

[FlyAtlas 2](http://flyatlas.gla.ac.uk/flyatlas/index.html) – Gene expression profile, based on in situ hybridization (reliability?)

[Virtual Fly Brain](http://www.virtualflybrain.org/site/vfb_site/home.htm) – Ties together transgenes/phenotypes/gene expression profile etc. for anatomical locations in the fly brain

[Interactive fly](http://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/aimain/1aahome.htm) – by Society for Developmental Biology, mostly anatomical and developmental resources on flies

# Some helpful tools for the wet lab

[FlyPrimerBank](http://www.flyrnai.org/FlyPrimerBank) – Primers for almost every fly gene, some already tested and commented on (paper on FlyPrimerBank by Hu et al. 2013)

[FlyC31](http://www.frontiers-in-genetics.org/flyc31/) – Resources on PhiC31 integrase system implemented in flies

## Crispr design tools

# Stock Centers

[VDRC RNAi stock center](http://stockcenter.vdrc.at/control/main) – mainly RNAi lines and associated lines, e.g. Dicer2

[Bloomington Fly Stock Center](http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/) – like the default stock center w/ big selection, esp. of Gal4 driver lines

# Miscellaneous

[Addgene](https://www.addgene.org) – extensive non-profit depository for plasmids/vectors, protocols, etc.
