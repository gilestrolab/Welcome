Trello
====================



What is Trello ?
--------------------
[Trello](https://trello.com/tour) is a free web service to manage tasks and projects.
It makes it very simple to keep track of what you want to do, what you have done,...

It is particularly useful when working on collaborative projects, because you can assign tasks to collaborator,
upload resources(pictures, links,...) and, for instance, notify people (eg `@johndoe please, do this for me`).
We also share an "organization" on Trello.

How to get Trello ?
--------------------
[The website](https://trello.com/) will let you create an account for free.
Then, you can do everything from your web browser/phone


Requesting access to our organisation
---------------------
In order to keep lab-related "boards" together, we have a group/organization.
To get access, send a request to Quentin or Giorgio.


Happy organizing
