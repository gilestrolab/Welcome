Gitub
====================


What is Github ?
--------------------
[Gitub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is a free web service designed to host software projects.

When to use Github ?
--------------------

* If your project involves writing some code.
* If you are doing some scripting of any kind (e.g. using `R` statistical software).
* If you are writing LaTeX report/papers.


When **not** to use Github ?
--------------------
Do not use github to store large data typically, you do **not** want to put on github:

* Videos (very bad)
* Sound
* Many/large images
* Any sort of large data (>10M) that a program could output


Requesting access to our organisation
---------------------
We share an organisation, `gilestrolab` on github. 
You can just ask any lab member to invite you.


Public or private repository?
---------------------
If you start a new project, and you want to create a repository,
consider/discuss beforehand whether you would like to make it public or private.



Happy coding
