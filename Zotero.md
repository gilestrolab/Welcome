Zotero
====================



What is Zotero ?
--------------------
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is an open source bibliography manager which helps
you to store references to publications and allows to easily integrate them in your papers/reports.
It is very useful because you can use it as a web browser plug-in.
We share a private collection within the lab so that we can upload the papers we have a common interest in,
the journal club papers and our own work.

How to get zotero ?
--------------------
[The website](https://www.zotero.org/) should provide straightforward installation instructions.
You will also need to sign-up


Requesting access to our library
---------------------
In order to get access to the library, drop and email to Quentin or Giorgio.


What to upload ?
----------------------
In addition to the papers we are interested in,
it would be useful if students could upload the PDFs of their reports in the `z_ourReports` folder, and name their files `YYYY_Name_VeryShortDescription.pdf`.

Also, if you pick a paper for the journal club, it would be nice to upload it under the `journalClubPapers` folder.

What happens when you leave the lab?
